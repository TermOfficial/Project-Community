# community.php
Basically a fixed repository for Project Community, This is abandoned for now.. 
# Can I use this?
Don't, this shit is not allowed to be used, use this and I'll make sure you don't use it ever again. Other people have permission to rehost it, but not you.
# Disclaimer
This Project is in a work in progress, probably will be abandoned, but I do not fucking care!

# Notes

Not finished, duh.

Comments are not there, as they were never implemented.

You are required to use MariaDB, as mysqlserver does not play nice with the code.

You need PHP 8.0, stuff will not play nice with the code either.
